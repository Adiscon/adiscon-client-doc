.. index:: System Requirements

System Requirements
===================

The MonitorWare Agent has minimal system requirements. The actual minimum
requirements depend on the type of installation. If the client is installed,
they are higher. The service has minimal requirements, enabling it to run on a
large variety of machines â€“ even highly utilized ones.

Client
------

* The client can be installed on modern Windows systems. This includes
  Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022, and newer versions.
  The operating system variant (Workstation, Server) is irrelevant. Legacy
  support is available for older systems where needed.
* The client is suited for 32bit and 64bit operating systems. It runs
  automatically on each platform in 32Bit or 64Bit mode.
* The client uses Microsoft .Net Framework technology. The Installer will
  automatically install the necessary .Net Framework components before
  installation. A network connection maybe required in order to download
  additional components.
* The client requires roughly 8 MB RAM in addition to the operating system
  minimum requirements. It also needs around 5 MB of disk space.

Service
-------

* The service has fewer requirements.
* It works under the same operating system versions.
* At runtime, the base service requires 5 MB of main memory and less than 5 MB
  of disk space. However, the actual resources used by the agent largely depend
  on the services configured.
* If the MonitorWare Agent shall just monitor the local systems event log,
  impact on the monitored system is barely noticeable, if at all visible.
* If the MonitorWare Agent acts as a central Syslog server receiving hundreds
  of messages per second, it needs many more resources. Even then, the actual
  load is depending on the actions carried out. Storing the messages to text
  files is much less performance intense than writing them to a database table,
  especially if the database engine is located on the same machine. As such,
  there is no single guideline for hardware sizing. It needs to be adapted to
  the expected workload. We have created an article on `performance optimization
  for Syslog server operations
  <https://www.mwagent.com/articles/performance-optimizing-syslog-server/>`_,
  which you may want to read.
* Please note however, that the service is specifically optimized to handle
  high throughput including message bursts (for example received via syslog).
* If you expect high volume burst and carry out time consuming actions (for
  example database writes), we highly recommend adding additional memory to the
  machine. Please note that the 32Bit Service is limited to 2GB of usable
  memory. The 64Bit version does not have any limit. A typical Syslog message
  (including overhead) takes roughly 4-8 KB. You can buffer up to
  100,000-200,000 messages in 1024 MB.
* Please note MonitorWare Agent is capable of storing such bursts temporarily
  in memory even if the machine would otherwise be too slow to process the
  messages.

InterActive SyslogViewer
------------------------

* `SyslogViewer <https://www.adiscon.com/tools/adiscons-interactive-SyslogViewer/>`_ can be installed on modern Windows systems. This includes
  Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022, and newer versions
* SyslogViewer runs in 32Bit mode only. When accessing ODBC data sources, make
  sure to configure System DSN in the 32Bit ODBC Admin.
* SyslogViewer uses Microsoft .Net Framework technology. The Installer will
  automatically install the necessary .Net Framework components before
  installation. A network connection maybe required in order to download
  additional components.
* SyslogViewer requires roughly 15 MB RAM in addition to the operating system
  minimum requirements. It also needs around 2 MB of disk space.

Adiscon LogAnalyzer
-------------------

* `Adiscon LogAnalyzer <https://loganalyzer.adiscon.com/>`_ requires a local web
  server installed. Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) or Apache with
  PHP support is recommended as
  Adiscon LogAnalyzer is a PHP based application. Adiscon LogAnalyzer is an
  optional component and not mandatory. We recommend using it with modern PHP
  versions (PHP 8.0 or higher) on Apache or IIS with current XAMPP, WAMP,
  or similar web server packages.
