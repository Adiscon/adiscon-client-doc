Installing the product is straightforward because a familiar Windows setup
program guides you through the process.

Multiple download variants are available so you can pick the package that
matches your environment; always install the most recent release to benefit
from the latest fixes and improvements.

Each installer automatically creates a Windows Firewall exception for the
service process during setup, ensuring the service can communicate right away
without additional manual steps.
