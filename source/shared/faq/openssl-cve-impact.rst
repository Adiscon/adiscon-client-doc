Are Adiscon products affected by recent OpenSSL CVEs?
=====================================================

This article explains how to assess the impact of OpenSSL security advisories on Adiscon products and determine whether specific CVEs affect your deployment.

Applies To
----------

* WinSyslog (current major version: 18.x, e.g., 18.1)
* EventReporter (current major version: 19.x, e.g., 19.1)
* MonitorWare Agent (current major version: 15.x, e.g., 15.1)
* Rsyslog Windows Agent (current major version: 8.x, e.g., 8.1)

Question
--------

Are Adiscon products affected by recent OpenSSL CVEs? Which OpenSSL version do the products use, and are the vulnerable components used?

Problem
-------

Customers may see OpenSSL security advisories (e.g., multiple CVEs from OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0, or 1.1.1/1.0.2 branches) and need to know:

* Whether the product is affected by specific CVEs
* Which OpenSSL version is shipped with the product
* Whether the vulnerable code paths or components are used

Symptoms
--------

* Security or compliance teams request a formal assessment of OpenSSL CVEs
* Scans or reports may flag the product due to bundled OpenSSL
* No observable runtime failure; this is a security/compliance assessment topic

Understanding OpenSSL Version Branches
--------------------------------------

OpenSSL uses a branch-based versioning system. Different branches receive different updates and have different vulnerability profiles:

* **OpenSSL 3.x branches:** 3.6.x, 3.5.x, 3.4.x, 3.3.x, 3.2.x, 3.1.x, 3.0.x
* **OpenSSL 1.1.1 branch:** Legacy LTS branch (now EOL)
* **OpenSSL 1.0.2 branch:** Legacy branch (now EOL)

**Important:** A CVE that affects OpenSSL 3.6.x may NOT affect OpenSSL 3.2.x unless explicitly listed in the advisory. Each CVE specifies which version branches are vulnerable.

Solution
--------

Determining If Your Product Is Affected
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To assess whether a specific OpenSSL CVE affects your Adiscon product installation:

1. **Identify the OpenSSL version used by your product:**

   * Check your product's release notes or version information
   * Contact Adiscon Support if the version is not documented
   * Example: If your product ships with OpenSSL 3.2.1, your branch is 3.2.x

2. **Review the OpenSSL security advisory:**

   * Visit the `OpenSSL Security Advisories page <https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html>`_
   * Locate the CVE you are investigating
   * Read the "Affected versions" section carefully

3. **Compare version branches:**

   * If the advisory lists "Affected: OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4" and your product uses OpenSSL 3.2.x, **you are not affected** by that CVE
   * If the advisory lists "Affected: OpenSSL 3.2" and your product uses OpenSSL 3.2.x, continue to step 4

4. **Check if vulnerable functionality is used:**

   * Some CVEs affect specific APIs or features that may not be used by the product
   * Review the CVE description to understand the vulnerable code path
   * Contact Adiscon Support for confirmation if the vulnerable functionality is used

Example Assessment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Scenario:** You see a security advisory for CVE-YYYY-XXXXX affecting OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, and 3.0.

**Your product:** WinSyslog 18.1 ships with OpenSSL 3.2.1

**Analysis:**

* The advisory explicitly lists branches: 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0
* Your product uses OpenSSL 3.2.x, which is NOT in the affected list
* **Conclusion:** Your product is NOT vulnerable to this CVE

OpenSSL Version Information by Product
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To determine the exact OpenSSL version in your installation:

**Method 1: Check Release Notes**

* Review the release notes for your product version
* Look for "OpenSSL" in the "Third-Party Components" or "Dependencies" section

**Method 2: Check Installation Directory**

* Navigate to your product installation directory
* Look for files named ``libssl*.dll`` or ``libcrypto*.dll``
* Right-click, select Properties, and check the Details tab for version information

**Method 3: Contact Support**

* If you cannot determine the OpenSSL version from available documentation
* Contact `Adiscon Support <https://www.adiscon.com/en/support/>`_ with your product name and version number
* Support can provide the exact OpenSSL version used in your build

Best Practices
--------------

* **Keep products up to date:** Always use the latest product version to receive security updates including OpenSSL updates
* **Monitor security advisories:** Subscribe to Adiscon security announcements and OpenSSL security mailing lists
* **Verify branch-specific impact:** Don't assume all OpenSSL CVEs affect all versions - always check the specific branches listed
* **Coordinate with Support:** For critical security assessments, work with Adiscon Support to get official vulnerability assessments
* **Plan updates proactively:** If a CVE affects your product, plan for updates during the next maintenance window

When to Contact Support
-----------------------

Contact Adiscon Support if you need:

* Confirmation of the exact OpenSSL version in your product build
* Official statement on whether a specific CVE affects your deployment
* Timeline for security updates if a vulnerability is confirmed
* Workarounds or mitigations while updates are being prepared
