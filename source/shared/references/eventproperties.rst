Event Properties
================

Events have certain properties, for example the message associated with the
event or the time it was generated. Each of this properties has an assigned
name. The actual properties available depend on the type of event. The
following sections describe both how to access properties as well as
properties available.

Knowing about event properties is important for building complex filter
conditions, customized actions as well as for integrating into a third-party
system. Event properties provide a generic way to look at and process the
events generated. Thus we highly recommend that you at least briefly read this
reference section.
