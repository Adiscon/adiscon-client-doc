Custom Properties
=================

Users can create an unlimited number of custom properties. These can be created
with for example the "PostProcess" action (if the product edition purchased
supports this action).

Custom properties can theoretically have any name, but Adiscon highly
recommends to prefix them with "u-" (e.g. "u-MyProperty" - "u" like "user").
This ensures that no compatibility problems will arise in current and future
versions of the software. Adiscon guarantees that it will never use the "u-"
prefix for Adiscon-assigned properties.

Custom properties can be used just like regular properties. Wherever you can
specify a property, you can also specify a custom property.
