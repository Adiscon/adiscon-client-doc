Diskspace Monitor
=================

This monitor checks the available and used space on all hard disks in the
system. All hard disks present in the system are automatically checked.
New disks are automatically detected. Low disk space is quickly detected and
can be used to trigger notifications or even corrective actions before problems
arise.
