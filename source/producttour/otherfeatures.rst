Other Miscellaneous Features
============================

External Events
---------------

Events are accepted via a standard Syslog server and hence all Syslog-enabled
devices can be included in the MonitorWare system. This includes popular
devices like routers and switches as well as printers and a large number of
UNIX/Linux based systems and applications. Virtually all currently existing
network devices support Syslog therefore MonitorWare Agent can monitor all of
them.

To reach an even broader device range, MonitorWare Agent not only supports
standards compatible Syslog but also it supports popular extensions like Syslog
over.

Scalability
-----------

The MonitorWare system is modular and highly scalable. If a single server is to
be monitored, MonitorWare Agent can provide all monitoring and alerting needs.
However, multiple MonitorWare Agents in a complex, hierarchical network can
talk to each other and provide both local and central alerting and event
archiving.

Zero-Impact Monitoring
----------------------

MonitorWare Agent has no noticeable impact on system resources. It was
specifically written with minimal resource usage in mind. In typical scenarios,
its footprint is barely traceable. This ensures it can also be installed on
heavily loaded servers.

Robustness
----------

MonitorWare Agent is written to perform robust even under unusual
circumstances. The reliability of the product is proven since 1996.

Ease of Use
-----------

MonitorWare Agent is easy to install and configure. Comprehensive
:doc:`step-by-step guides <../stepbystepguides>` and wizards help
administrators with setting up even complex systems.

Firewall Support
----------------

Does your security policy enforce you to use non-standard ports? MonitorWare
Agent can be configured to listen on any TCP/IP port for Syslog messages.

Runs on large Variety of Windows Systems
----------------------------------------

It runs on Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2016/2019/2022. The operating
system variant (Workstation, Server â€¦) is irrelevant. Note: For legacy systems
(Windows XP, Server 2003), older versions are available - contact Adiscon for details.
