Test Passive Syslog Service
===========================

The MonitorWare Agent client comes with Test Passive Syslog Service.  Make sure
the Service is started (or restarted) after you finished configuration of the
Passive Syslog Listener. The test window will automatically be filled with
correct properties and is ready to go. If the test succeeds, the data grid
should rapidly fill with queued syslog messages.
