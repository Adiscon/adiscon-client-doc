Obtaining a Printable Manual
============================

A printable version of the manual can be obtained at http://www.Rsyslog.com

The manuals offered on this web page are in printable (in PDF format) or HTML
Versions for easy browsing and printing. The manual is also included as a
standard Windows help file with all installations. So if you have the product
already installed, there is no need to download these documents.

The version on the web might also include some new additions, as we post manual
changes frequently â€“ including new samples and as soon as they become
available. Past manual versions are also available for those customers in need
of it.
