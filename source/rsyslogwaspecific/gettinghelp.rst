Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

For a current list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), please visit
http://www.Rsyslog.com/professional-services/. The FAQ area is continuously being updated.

Customer Service System
-----------------------

Our Customer Service System is available at https://ticket.adiscon.com.
With it, you can quickly open a support ticket via a web-based interface. This
system can be used to place both technical support calls as well as general and
sales questions. We would appreciate if you select the appropriate category
when opening your ticket.

**Please note:** the Customer Service System asks you for a User name or email
and Password when you open it. If you do not have registered yet, you can
simply click the "register now" button to do so. If you choose the continue "as
guest" button you can also open a ticket without registering first.

**Why using the Customer Service System?** As you see further below, we also offer support by email. In fact, email is just another way to create a ticket

in the Customer Service System. Whenever we reply to your ticket, the system
automatically generates an email notification, which includes a link to your
ticket as well as the answer we have provided. However, there are some
situations where the support system should be used:


  •**Email notifications do NOT include attachments!** If we provide an attachment, you must login into the ticket in order to obtain this. For your
  convenience, each email notification contains an active link that allows you to
  login immediately.

  •**If you seem to not receive responses from us, it is a very good idea to
  check the web interface. Unfortunately, anti-SPAM measures are being setup more
  and more aggressive**. We are noticing an increasing number of replies that
  simply do not make it to your mailbox, because some SPAM filter considered it
  to be SPAM and removed it. Also, it may happen that your support question
  actually did not get past our own SPAM filter. We try very hard to avoid this.
  If we discard mail, we send a notification of this, so you should at least have
  an indication that your mail did not reach us. Using the customer support
  system via its own web interface removes all SPAM troubles. So we highly
  recommend doing this if communication otherwise seems to be disturbed. In this
  case, please remember that notification emails may also get lost, so it is a
  good idea to check your ticket for status updates from time to time.


**Email**

Please address all support requests to service@adiscon.com. An appropriate
subject line is highly appreciated.

**Please note: we have increasingly seen problems with too-aggressive SPAM**
filtering, resulting in loss of our replies. If you do not receive a response
from us within two working days, we highly recommend re-submitting your support
call via the** `Customer Service System <https://ticket.adiscon.com>`_.
