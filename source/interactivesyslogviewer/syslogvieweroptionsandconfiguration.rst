Options & Configuration
=======================

InterActive SyslogViewer is an add-on to the MonitorWare Agent and WinSyslog.
**Please note that it is a utility program, with a primary focus on real-time**
troubleshooting.**

InterActive SyslogViewer is **not** meant to continuously monitor a system. This
is what the service is designed for. While InterActive SyslogViewer allows to
view current syslog traffic, the service should be used for all other purposes,
like creating log files.
