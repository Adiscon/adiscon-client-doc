Live Syslog View
================

Primarily, the InterActive SyslogViewer is used for viewing current syslog
traffic. All messages are shown in a list with the most important information.
These are the Priority, Facility, Date&Time, Source, RealSource and the
Message. At the beginning of each line you can see the number of the logged
event and a checkbox, for you to track if a message has been read.

The status bar at the bottom of the screen shows you, if the SyslogViewer is
running or stopped and how much time you have left for the trial or your
licensing status.
