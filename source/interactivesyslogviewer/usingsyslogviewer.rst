Using InterActive SyslogViewer
==============================

InterActive SyslogViewer is an add-on to MonitorWare Agent and WinSyslog.

**Please note that it is a utility program with a primary focus on real-time troubleshooting**.

Interactive Syslog server is not meant to continuously monitor a system. This is
what the service is designed for. While Interactive Server allows to view
current Syslog traffic, the service should be used for all other purposes, like
creating log files.
