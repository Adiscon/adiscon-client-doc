Question
--------

Are MonitorWare Agent products affected by recent OpenSSL CVEs? Which OpenSSL version do the products use, and are the vulnerable components used?

Problem
-------

Customers may see OpenSSL security advisories (e.g., multiple CVEs from OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0, or 1.1.1/1.0.2 branches) and need to know:

- Whether MonitorWare Agent is affected by specific CVEs
- Which OpenSSL version is shipped with MonitorWare Agent
- Whether the vulnerable code paths or components are used

Symptoms
--------

- Security or compliance teams request a formal assessment of OpenSSL CVEs for MonitorWare Agent
- Scans or reports may flag MonitorWare Agent due to bundled OpenSSL
- No observable runtime failure; this is a security/compliance assessment topic

Solution
--------

MonitorWare Agent v15.x uses a specific OpenSSL version (e.g., 3.2.1). OpenSSL advisories list affected version ranges per CVE. Many CVEs affect only certain release branches (e.g., 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1, 1.0.2) and do **not** include all minor lines (e.g., 3.2.x).

If MonitorWare Agent ships OpenSSL from a branch that is not in the affected set for a given CVE, the product is not vulnerable to that CVE regardless of whether the vulnerable API exists in the code base.

**Assessment Process:**

1. Identify the OpenSSL version bundled with your MonitorWare Agent build
   - Check the product release notes or contact Adiscon Support for your specific build
   - Current major version: MonitorWare Agent 15.x (e.g., 15.1)

2. Review the CVE advisory on the OpenSSL Security page
   - Note which OpenSSL version ranges are listed as affected
   - Verify whether the bundled version falls within the affected range

3. Determine vulnerability status
   - If the bundled OpenSSL version is not in the affected range, MonitorWare Agent is not vulnerable
   - If the bundled version is in the affected range, contact Adiscon Support for guidance on updates or mitigation

**Important Notes:**

- OpenSSL version information for your specific build can be obtained from Adiscon Support
- Adiscon monitors security advisories and provides updates as necessary
- For the most current information, consult the MonitorWare Agent release notes or contact Support
