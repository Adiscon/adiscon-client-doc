SNMP Traps
==========

Using SNMP Traps, since MonitorWare Agent 3.0 now can be used to manage and
monitor all sorts of equipment including computers, routers, wiring hubs,
toasters, and jukeboxes.

A trap is generated when the device feels it should do so and it contains the
information that the device feels should be transmitted.
