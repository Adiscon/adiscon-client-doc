Registration Name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**File Configuration field:**
  szlicense

**Description**
  The user chooses the registration name. It should correspond to your
  organization name, e.g. a company called "AA Carpenters, Inc." should not
  choose "AA" as registration name. This can easily be mistaken and most
  probably be rejected by Adiscon for that reason. With the above scenario,
  we recommend using the full company name "AA Carpenters, Inc.".

  Please note: The registration name is case sensitive. It must be entered
  exactly as given. Leading and trailing spaces are also part of the
  registration name, so be sure to enter none.


Registration number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**File Configuration field:**
  nLicenseKey1, nLicenseKey2, nLicenseKey3, nLicenseKey4, nLicenseKey5

**Description**
  Adiscon provides this number. It is valid for a specific registration name.
  Be sure to enter the correct registration number. Each block of the license
  key must be filled into one of the key fields. Alternatively, you can use
  the "Import from Clipboard" button. The client detects invalid registration
  numbers and reports the corresponding error.


Import from Clipboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the key has been copied to the clipboard it can be imported with this button.


Verify License
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here it can be verified if the license is valid.
