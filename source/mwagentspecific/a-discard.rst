Discard
=======

A Discard Action immediately destroys the current Information Unit and any
action of any rule that has been defined after the Discard action execution.
When this action has been selected then no dialog appears as nothing needs to be
configured for this.

A sample how to ignore Events with the Discard Action can be found here:
:doc:`ignoring events <../shared/gettingstarted/ignoringevents>`.
