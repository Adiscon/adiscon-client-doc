MonitorWare Agent offers advanced monitoring capabilities. It cannot only
monitor the system it is installed on; it can also include information received
from Syslog-enabled devices. To fully unleash MonitorWare's power, you need to
learn a bit about its concepts. These web resources (provided links) describe
each element in detail.


MonitorWare Agent operates on a set of elements. These are


* :doc:`services <glossaryofterms/mwconcepts-services>`

* :doc:`information units <glossaryofterms/mwconcepts-informationunit>`

* :doc:`filter conditions <glossaryofterms/mwconcepts-filterconditions>`

* :doc:`actions <glossaryofterms/mwconcepts-actions>`

* :doc:`rules <glossaryofterms/rules>`

* :doc:`the setp protocol <glossaryofterms/setp>`


It is vital to understand each element and the way they interact. MonitorWare
Agent has multiple and very powerful capabilities. This enables very quick
configuration of highly efficient and comprehensive systems. On the other hand,
the concepts must be fully understood to make such complex systems really work
