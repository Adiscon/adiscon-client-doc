Overview
--------

This FAQ explains WinSyslog's Freeware Mode, which provides free functionality for home users while offering advanced capabilities in the Professional edition.

What is Freeware Mode?
----------------------

**Adiscon cares for the home user.** There are two versions of WinSyslog - the "InterActive SyslogViewer" and "WinSyslog Professional". The free edition is targeted to the home user. It offers a free, interactive scrolling display of received syslog messages in InterActive SyslogViewer. The 60 most current messages can be viewed in this mode. There is no time limit for this functionality. This mode is referred to as "Freeware Mode".

**The Professional edition offers advanced capabilities** like logging to file or database and an enhanced rule processing engine.

How Does Licensing Work?
-------------------------

**After installation, the product starts as Professional version.** If the professional version is not purchased within 30 days, the product automatically switches to freeware mode. So there is no need to worry about unlicensed usage in this case.

Key Features of Freeware Mode
------------------------------

* **Interactive message display**: View the 60 most current syslog messages
* **No time limit**: Use the freeware mode indefinitely
* **Free support**: Even free copies come with Adiscon's great support
* **Home user focused**: Perfect for personal and home environments

Professional Edition Benefits
------------------------------

For users requiring advanced capabilities, the Professional edition provides:

* **File logging**: Persistent storage of syslog messages to files
* **Database logging**: Store events in databases via ODBC
* **Enhanced rule processing**: Powerful filtering and event processing engine
* **Advanced actions**: Email notifications, forwarding, and more

Automatic Mode Transition
--------------------------

The transition from Professional to Freeware Mode is automatic and hassle-free:

1. WinSyslog starts in Professional mode after installation
2. A 30-day evaluation period is provided
3. If not licensed within 30 days, it automatically switches to Freeware Mode
4. No manual intervention required - the system handles the transition
