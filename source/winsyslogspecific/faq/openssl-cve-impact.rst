Question
--------

Are WinSyslog products affected by recent OpenSSL CVEs? Which OpenSSL version do the products use, and are the vulnerable components used?

Problem
-------

Customers may see OpenSSL security advisories (e.g., multiple CVEs from OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0, or 1.1.1/1.0.2 branches) and need to know:

- Whether WinSyslog is affected by specific CVEs
- Which OpenSSL version is shipped with WinSyslog
- Whether the vulnerable code paths or components are used

Symptoms
--------

- Security or compliance teams request a formal assessment of OpenSSL CVEs for WinSyslog
- Scans or reports may flag WinSyslog due to bundled OpenSSL
- No observable runtime failure; this is a security/compliance assessment topic

Solution
--------

WinSyslog v18.x uses a specific OpenSSL version (e.g., 3.2.1). OpenSSL advisories list affected version ranges per CVE. Many CVEs affect only certain release branches (e.g., 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1, 1.0.2) and do **not** include all minor lines (e.g., 3.2.x).

If WinSyslog ships OpenSSL from a branch that is not in the affected set for a given CVE, the product is not vulnerable to that CVE regardless of whether the vulnerable API exists in the code base.

**Information:**

- OpenSSL versions are embedded into the product statically without dependencies on system-installed versions
- The product uses its own bundled OpenSSL library, independent of any OpenSSL installation on the system
- This means system OpenSSL updates do not affect the product, and conversely, the product's OpenSSL does not affect system security

**Important Notes:**

- OpenSSL version information for your specific build can be obtained from Adiscon Support
- Adiscon monitors security advisories and provides updates as necessary
- For the most current information, consult the WinSyslog release notes or contact Support
