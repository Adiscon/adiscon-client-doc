Other Miscellaneous Features
============================

Full Logging
------------

WinSyslog logs the received syslog message together with its priority and
facility code as well as the sender's system IP address and date. It is also
able to log abnormally formatted packages (without or with invalid priority /
facility), so no message will be lost.

Interactive Server
------------------

Use the Interactive Syslog server to interactively display messages as they
arrive. Message buffer size is configurable and only limited by the amount of
memory installed in the machine.

Powerful Actions
----------------

Each message received is processed by WinSyslog's powerful and extremely
flexible rule engine. Each rule defines which actions to carry out (e. g. email
message or store to a database) when the message matches the rule's filter
condition. Among others, filter conditions are string matches inside the
message or syslog facility or priority. There are an unlimited number of filter
conditions and actions per rule available.

Freeware Mode
-------------

We care for the home user! WinSyslog can operate as freeware in so-called
"freeware mode" without a valid license. It supports a scrolling interactive
display of the 60 most current messages for an unlimited time. This feature is
most commonly requested for home environments. And: even our free copies come
with Adiscon's great support!

Standards Compatible
--------------------

WinSyslog is compatible with the syslog RFC 3164. It operates as a original
sender (device), server and relay. All specified operation modes are supported.
Non-RFC compliance can be configured by the administrator to fine-tune
WinSyslog to the local environment (e.g. timestamps can be taken from the local
system instead of the reporting device in case the device clocks are unreliable).

Syslog Hierarchy
----------------

WinSyslog supports cascaded configurations most commonly found in larger
organizations. In a cascaded configuration, there are local WinSyslog instances
running at department or site level which report important events to a central
WinSyslog in the headquarter. There is no limit on the number of levels in a
cascaded system.

WinSyslog Web Access
--------------------

Never need to look at plain text files! WinSyslog comes with a fully functional
ASP application that will display the contents of WinSyslog generated database
entries. The ASP pages are in full source code and can easily be customized.

Multiple Instances
------------------

WinSyslog supports running multiple syslog servers on the same machine. Each
instance can listen to a different syslog port, either via TCP or UDP and be
bound to a different ruleset for execution.

Ease of Use
-----------

Using the new WinSyslog Client interface, the product is very easy to set up and
customize. We also support full documentation and support for large-scale
unattended installations.

Robustness
----------

WinSyslog is written to perform robust even under unusual circumstances. Its
reliability has been proven at customers sites since 1996.

Minimal Resource Usage
----------------------

WinSyslog has no noticeable impact on system resources. It was specifically
written with minimal resource usage in mind. In typical scenarios, its
footprint is barely traceable. This ensures it can also be installed on heavily
loaded servers.

Firewall Support
----------------

Does your security policy enforce you to use a non-standard syslog port?
WinSyslog can be configured to listen on any TCP/IP port for syslog messages.

NT Service
----------

The WinSyslog service is implemented as a native multithreaded Windows
service. It can be controlled via the control panel services applet or the
computer management MMC.

Full Modern Windows Support
---------------------------

WinSyslog provides comprehensive support for all current Windows operating
systems, taking advantage of modern Windows features and security enhancements.

Runs on Wide Variety of Windows Systems
---------------------------------------

WinSyslog runs on all current Windows versions including Windows 10, Windows 11,
Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022, and newer versions. Both Workstation and Server
editions are fully supported. Legacy support for Windows XP and Server 2003
is available in older product versions only.
