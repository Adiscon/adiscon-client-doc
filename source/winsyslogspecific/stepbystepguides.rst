Step-by-Step Guides
===================

The step-by-step guides are meant to get you started quickly. They provide
information on how to configure the product in common scenarios. Each section
includes the information necessary to complete a specific task.

The information is presented in an easy to follow "step by step" way (hence the
name). Each section begins with the intended result and then explains the steps
to achieve it in the correct order. They are documented together with
hardcopies, so they should be easy to follow. For best results, please be sure
to follow the exact order of the steps.

The step-by-step guides do eventually not include all information that might be
relevant to the situation. Please use your own judgment if the scenario
described sufficiently matches your need.

In the step-by-step guides, we assume the product is already successfully
installed but no configuration has been done. If it is not installed, please do
so first.

All step-by-step guides assume that the client is running. This is kind of a
step 0 for all the guides.
