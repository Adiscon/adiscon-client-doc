Getting Started
===============

**WinSyslog** can be used for simple as well as complex scenarios.

This chapter provides a quick overview of the agent and what can be done
with it.

Most importantly, it contains a tutorial touching many of the basic tasks that
can be done with WinSyslog as well as pointer on how to set up and configure.

Be sure to at least briefly read this section and then decide where to go from
here - it will definitely be a worth time spent.
