   **Installation is quick and easy. The WinSyslog Service uses a standard installation wizard.**

   We highly recommend visiting our `Online Seminars <https://www.adiscon.com/seminars-online>`_ to access the online seminars
   on WinSyslog as well as other members of this product family. These are not marketing videos but technically packed
   presentations that help you get started quickly and efficiently.

   The installation walkthrough at `Installing WinSyslog <https://www.mwagent.com/step-by-step-guides/installation-and-configuration/how-to-setup-monitorware-agent-WinSyslog-and-EventReporter>`_
   is a helpful reference, and WinSyslog is part of `Adiscon's MonitorWare line of products <../glossaryofterms/mwlineofproducts.html>`_.

   WinSyslog installers are available from the `Download Versions <https://www.WinSyslog.com/download>`_ page. Launch the setup
   by double-clicking ``wnsyslog.exe`` and following the onscreen instructions.
