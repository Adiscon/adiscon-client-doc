**EventReporter** can be used for simple as well as complex scenarios.

This chapter provides a quick overview of EventReporter and what can be
done with it.

Most importantly, it contains a tutorial touching many of the basic tasks that
can be done with MonitorWare Agent as well as pointer on how to setup and
configure.

Be sure to at least briefly read this section and then decide where to go from
here - it is definitely a worth time spent.
