EventReporter
=============

`EventReporter <https://www.EventReporter.com/>`_ is Adiscon's solution to
forward Windows Event Log entries from all supported Windows versions
to a central system.

These central systems can be either `WinSyslog <https://www.WinSyslog.com/>`_ ,
other Syslog daemons (e.g. on UNIX), or `MonitorWare Agent <https://www.mwagent.com/>`_.
EventReporter is part of :doc:`adiscon's monitorware line of products <../glossaryofterms/mwlineofproducts>`.
