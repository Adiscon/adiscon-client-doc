RFC 3164
========

RFC 3164 is a `IETF <https://www.ietf.org/>`_ document. It describes how
`syslog <https://www.adiscon.com/syslog/>`_ messages have been seen in traditional implementations. RFC 3164 is not
a standard but rather a descriptive ("informational" in IETF terms) document.
It does not demand a specific behavior but rather documents what has been
seen. Some existing implementations of real-world syslog use different formats.

RFC 3164 is just the first step towards a newer and better syslog standard.
A standard already produced by this working group is :doc:`rfc 3195 <../glossaryofterms/rfc3195>`, which
describes how syslog can be sent reliably over a :doc:`tcp <../glossaryofterms/tcp>` connection.

Adiscon supports RFC 3164 messages. There are a number of switches in each
product to take care of those implementation that do it slightly different.

The formal specification for RFC 3164 can be found in the `IETF RFC <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt>`_ repository.
