FTP
===

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is the best means for moving large
files across the Internet. FTP is a client/server protocol that enables a user
with an FTP client to log on to a remote machine, navigate the file system of
that remote machine, and upload and download files from that machine.

There are two basic types of FTP on the Internet anonymous ftp and private ftp.
With anonymous ftp, one logs in as user anonymous, giving one's email address
as a password. With private FTP, one logs in with the username and password one
has established on that particular system. You are logged into your home
directory, with all the file permissions you would normally have there.
