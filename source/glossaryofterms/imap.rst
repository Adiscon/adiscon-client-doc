IMAP
====

Internet Message Access Protocol. A protocol allowing a client to access and
manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. It permits manipulation of
remote message folders (mailboxes), in a way that is functionally equivalent to
local mailboxes.

IMAP includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes;
checking for new messages; permanently removing messages; searching; and
selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.
It does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail
transfer protocol such as SMTP.
