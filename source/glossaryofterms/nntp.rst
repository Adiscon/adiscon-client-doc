NNTP
====

NNTP stands for Network News Transport Protocol. This protocol is used by
client and server software to carry USENET postings back and forth over a
TCP/IP network.

When you are using any of the common software like modern web browsers or
newsreaders, you are taking benefit of the NNTP connection to participate in
newsgroups.
