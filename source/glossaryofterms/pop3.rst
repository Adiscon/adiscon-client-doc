POP3
====

POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) is the most recent version of a standard protocol
for receiving e-mail. POP3 is a client/server protocol in which e-mail is
received and held for you by your Internet server. Periodically, you (or your
client e-mail receiver) check your mail-box on the server and download any
mail. It is also built into modern web browsers and email clients.
