HTTP
====

HyperText Transfer Protocol, the underlying protocol used by the World Wide
Web. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what action
Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. For
example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP
command to the Web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested Web
page.
