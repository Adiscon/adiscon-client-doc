RFC 3195
========

RFC 3195 is an `IETF <https://www.ietf.org/>`_ standard. It specifies how `syslog <https://www.adiscon.com/syslog/>`_ messages
can reliably be transmitted via a :doc:`tcp <../glossaryofterms/tcp>` connection.
RFC 3195 optionally allows for message encryption and authentication of sender
and receiver. However, it has not receive any importance in practice. Servers
are hard to find.

:doc:`adiscon's monitorware line of products <../glossaryofterms/mwlineofproducts>` implement the core RFC 3195 protocol
(actually, `Adiscon was the first one to do this on the Windows platform <https://www.adiscon.com/monitorwareagent/monitorware-agent-1-3-released/>`_). Under
UNIX `Rsyslog <https://www.Rsyslog.com/>`_ and `SDSC syslog <https://security.sdsc.edu/index.php/Main_Page>`_ are known to support RFC 3195. Our `liblogging <https://www.Rsyslog.com/liblogging/>`_
project enables your own applications to "talk" 3195.

The formal specification for RFC 3195 can be found in the `IETF RFC repository <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3195.txt>`_ .

During its creation, RFC 3195 was known as "syslog-reliable". Many people still
use this name to refer to it.
