Glossary of Terms
=================

**Unfortunately, in the IT world terms are not necessarily used the same way**
by all people.**

To clarify what we are talking about, we have created a glossary of terms as we
at Adiscon understand them. Of course, we try hard to stay with the mainstream
definitions.

This list includes both general IT terms as well as Adiscon-specific terms. We
hope this glossary of terms will be useful for all interested parties.
