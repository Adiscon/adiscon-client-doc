Database
========

A database is a structural approach to data storage and retrieval. Database
systems are optimized for quickly storing and retrieving data. In the MonitorWare
products, databases are used to persistently store event data, enabling powerful
filtering, searching, and reporting capabilities. MonitorWare supports various
database systems including MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and
any other database with ODBC support. The database enables you to maintain a
centralized repository of all your log data for compliance, forensics, and
operational intelligence.
