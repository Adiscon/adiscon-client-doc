SNMP
====

SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. A set of standards for
communication with devices connected to a TCP/IP network, like routers, hubs
and switches. A device is said to be SNMP compatible if it can be monitored
and/or controlled using SNMP messages.

SNMP messages are known as PDU's - Protocol Data Units. Devices that are SNMP
compatible contain SNMP 'agent' software to receive, send, and act upon SNMP
messages. Software for managing devices via SNMP are available for every kind
of commonly used computer and are often bundled along with the device they are
designed to manage. Some SNMP software is designed to handle a wide variety of
devices.
