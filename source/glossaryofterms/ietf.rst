IETF
====

The IETF is an important Internet standards body. `IETF <https://www.ietf.org/>`_ is a short name for
"Internet Engineering Task Force". The IETF is responsible for the creation of
RFCs. Unlike other, formal standards bodies it is loosely organized. There is
no specific membership to the IETF, anyone (knowledgeable) can become an IETF
member just by participating on the IETF discussion mailing lists.

The IETF itself provides a good overview over itself at
https://www.ietf.org/about/mission/.
